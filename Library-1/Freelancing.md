- Response time is less
- Profile picture is professional
	- If you don't have any professional pic, just change the background
	- If you get only a 1 nice headshot, you can literally do lot of combinations and same can be used in gigs thumbnails also
- Catchy tagline
- Focus on less delivery time & less cost
- Gig thumbnail should be similar to YouTube, must be look friendly
