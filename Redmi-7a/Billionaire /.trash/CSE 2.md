- Routh Criterion : No. of sign changes 
- Special cases 
	Special case 1 : 1st element is zero, rest row is non zero, 
		Method 1: Replace 0 by €
		Method 2: Replace s by 1/z & take L.C.M 
	Special case 2 : Entire row is zero
		Method : Differentiate previous row
	Example : s⁵ +3s⁴ +2s³ +2s² +3s +5
