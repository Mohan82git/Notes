###### Acne or pimple-like spots on your face after excessive masturbation could be due to hormonal changes, stress, or poor hygiene habits like touching your face often. Here's how you can reduce or prevent them:

###### Immediate Care:
###### 1. **Wash Your Face Regularly**: Use a gentle, non-comedogenic face wash twice daily to keep your skin clean.
###### 2. **Avoid Touching Your Face**: Hands carry bacteria that can lead to breakouts.
###### 3. **Use Over-the-Counter Treatments**: Products containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil can help reduce inflammation and unclog pores.
###### 4. **Keep Your Skin Hydrated**: Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to maintain skin balance.
###### 5. **Apply Ice or a Warm Compress**: Ice can reduce swelling, and a warm compress can help bring a pimple to a head.

###### Long-Term Prevention:
###### 1. **Maintain Proper Skin Hygiene**: Wash pillowcases and towels regularly to avoid bacterial build-up.
###### 2. **Healthy Diet**: Consume foods rich in antioxidants (fruits, vegetables) and avoid greasy or sugary foods.
###### 3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water helps in detoxifying your skin.
###### 4. **Avoid Excessive Masturbation**: Reducing the frequency might help if it's triggering hormonal imbalances.
###### 5. **Exercise & Manage Stress**: Exercise helps in regulating hormones and reduces stress, which can improve your skin.

###### If the problem persists or worsens, it might be helpful to see a dermatologist to get a more personalized treatment plan.
###### You're welcome! Here are a few more cooling techniques you can try:

###### 12. **Use a Wet Sheet or Towel**:
   ###### - Dampen a large sheet or towel with cold water and hang it near the window or door. As the air passes through the wet fabric, it cools down, creating a natural evaporative cooling effect.

###### 13. **Cool Shower or Bath**:
   ###### - Take a cool shower before studying to lower your body temperature. Even splashing cold water on your face, arms, and feet can help.

###### 14. **Elevate Your Study Space**:
   ###### - Heat rises, so if possible, raise your chair or bed slightly so you're closer to a cooler part of the room (floor level is usually warmer). You can use a study table that isn’t directly against a warm wall or under a light source.

###### 15. **Chilled Wristbands or Neckbands**:
   ###### - Purchase or make cooling wristbands or neckbands. These can be placed in the freezer and worn around the wrists or neck to keep your body cool.

###### 16. **Cooling Mattress/Chair Pads**:
   ###### - Use a cooling gel mat or pad on your chair or bed. These pads contain a cooling gel that absorbs body heat and can be a great option for longer study sessions.

###### 17. **Eat Light and Cool Foods**:
   ###### - Avoid heavy meals as digestion generates heat. Opt for light meals like salads, fruits, yogurt, and cold soups. Eating cold foods can help cool you from the inside out.

###### 18. **Turn Off Lights and Electronics**:
   ###### - Lights, especially incandescent bulbs, generate heat. Keep them off or switch to LED bulbs. Also, unplug electronics like chargers and appliances not in use, as they emit heat even when idle.

###### 19. **Sleep with a Cold Pillow**:
   ###### - If you are feeling hot during the night, try chilling your pillowcase or even the entire pillow in the freezer for a few minutes before bed.

###### 20. **Frozen Rice Pack**:
   ###### - Fill a sock with rice, tie it off, and place it in the freezer for a couple of hours. The rice will retain the cold longer than ice packs and can be used to cool down.

###### 21. **DIY Cooling Fan (Without a Fan)**:
   ###### - You can make a simple DIY "cooler" by placing a shallow tray of water and ice in front of an open window. This can help cool the air naturally as the breeze passes over the tray.

###### 22. **Minimize Heat-Producing Activities**:
   ###### - Avoid activities like cooking or exercising indoors during the hottest part of the day. Even heavy studying or mental work can cause your body to heat up, so take frequent breaks.

###### 23. **Use Reflective Window Film**:
   ###### - Apply reflective window film to the window if sunlight is the main cause of the heat. It helps block out a significant portion of heat and UV rays.

###### Combining these ideas should make a noticeable difference in keeping you cool, even without turning on the fan! Let me know if you need more suggestions.
