2. **Forehead & Brow Ridge:**
    
    - A **prominent brow ridge** and a **lower, flatter forehead** lean towards masculinity.
    - A **smooth forehead** and a **less pronounced brow ridge** are considered more feminine.

    - **Thicker, straighter eyebrows** look more masculine.
    - **Thinner, more arched eyebrows** give a feminine appearance.
    - **Larger, rounder eyes** are linked to femininity, while **smaller, deeper-set eyes** are seen as masculine.
4. **Nose:**
    
    - A **broader, larger nose** is associated with masculinity.
