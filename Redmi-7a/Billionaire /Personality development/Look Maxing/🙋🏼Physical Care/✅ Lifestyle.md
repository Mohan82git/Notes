Bonus Tips 

- If you want to add one serum into your skincare journey, it should be vitamin C 
- You don't really need a lot of products in your skincare. Cleaning, hydrating and sun protection is more than enough.
- Scrub/ Exfoliation does not make your skin very clean or better
- Wash your face before going to bed
- You shouldn't wash your face more than 2x a day.
- If your skin is oily, do not skip moisturiser thinking it's oily, your skin produces a extra oil when it gets dry. So moisturiser is a must in any season.
- Keep your products affordable
- Have a good diet
- If you can't remove dark circles, hydrate your under eye skin hydrated and moisturized
