Project meetings and discussions

Tasks, questions, information sharing

## Meeting 1
1. Take printout of base reasearch paper, all papers refered by base paper, paper given by her
2. We have to go to company and make proposal for resources required, costing, Market survey
3. Make 20-25 slides of PPT , in that ppt add following points 
	- What are objectives, goals
	- perspective,
	- expected outcomes
	- expected results
## Meeting 2 :
1. So do you know what are citations? what are abstract? 
2. Download this research paper
3. Normally We get renewable energy then produce green hydrogen for sustainability and make 0 carbon emissions 
4. Abstract: it is 250-300 words gist about research, 
5. Keywords: Find keywords in research papers, they tell that research is focused on which thing
6. We also have to publish paper and it should also contain abstract, keywords, No grammatical mistakes, Third person should understand, 
7. Brieft idea of our project: We produce h2 via taking electricity from Solar or wind energy as input to electrolyser, which are having low efficiency, then that h2 is stored in cylinders
8. You have to study reference papers in sequence which they are given at the end of base research paper
9. Study gibbs free energy, faradays efficiency 
10. Go through NPTEL course
11. Reade this base paper, and other also
12. Most important topic of our project is mathematical modelling 
13. We have to go to h2e company for giving presentation and discussions 
14. Find out, from your group which member is strong in which field and distribute the work
15. But everyone should know each and every concept
16. I will give marks according to contribution of each member regarding completion of this project
17. To do:
	- Mathematical modeling and methodology 
	- Read paper, 
	- study electrolysis model
	- Fuel cell / hydrogen (models)
	- Understand this chemical and other equations
	- Solve NPTEL Assignments
	- Basic concepts of hydrogen
	- Enthalpy, basic equation
	- What is it's mass, energy density
	- Expected results, outcomes, objectives
	- Add 15 references in ppt
	- Someone may be formed complete matlab model for this project, so find free models of it on internet
## Meeting 3: 
1. So do you know input and output of electrolyser? 
2. Did you read reasearch paper?
3. Do you watched NPTEL course? 


## Meeting 4: 
1. Question on ppt we made: Is the electrolyser gives output based on input? 
2. If 1 kw is given to electrolyser will be the output same?
3. What happened with mathematical modelling? solved any examples? Atleast solve 5 numericals for it
4. Why you added 30 slides to ppt, add 10-15 slides do following corrections
	1. Add motivation, significance, literature survey, some research gap
	2. How will it benefit to society
	3. How will it reduce carbon footprint 
	4. Sustained development
5. Prepare basics thoroughly 
6. How will you implement it
7. Might be there are some books for this project find and read them
8. You must know the answer and meaning of each words and question asked on them
9. If you are doing something in project please learn how you gonna do that 
10. Do 10-15 slides, containing following topics
	1. Title, Why this title
	2. Literature survey, 
	3. where the india currently in this area, 
	4. What tech is cost effective for this
	5. Focus on optimization


## Meeting 5 : After the title fixation 
( that external sir told some corrections )

1. Write objectives
2. Remove simulation and analysis from title 
3. she said, "mm....take this title hydrogen production effectiveness improvement by increasing electrolyser efficiency"
4. What analysis will you do
5. Hydrogen is get produced and that effectiveness is depends on electrolyser efficiency
6. Did you designed 1 kw electrolyser model?
7. To check h2 production effectiveness, you have to decide what type of electrolyser will you give best efficienc. Suppose if you used alkaline electrolyser we get 70%, but in advanced electrolyser we get 82%
8. Key factor : If focused on this, indirectly it will help the h2 production effectiveness
9. So final title will be Analysis of hydrogen production effectiveness by improving electrolysis efficiency
10. You  have to continuously do the experiments and after the improvements, we really get hydrogen production effectiveness?
11. In new ppt add following objectives: 
	- Improve electrolyser efficiency 
	- Analysis of h2 production i.e if we improve efficiency by this way, how much will hydrogen production will get improve
12. Sir told to add following topics+ learn them ( points with # to be added in ppt, points with ? have to study, points with #? should be studied and added)
	1. Keep your aim and objectives specific #
	2. Study what is membrane, what are its optimization, its defination, everything ?
	3. Matlab required Data overview #? 
	4. Add and study effectiveness #?
	5. Where the hydrogen is exactly used #?
	6. What is this enthalpy and entropy change #?
	7. Membrane size, type, variety ?
	8. Gibbs free energy #?
	9. what Membrane material used?
	
13. Find how much h2 is produced for 1 kw electricity input find in actual units ( cubic meter)
14. We have to study effectiveness and efficiency, effectiveness is related to hydrogen, efficiency is related to electrolyser, so focus on efficiency
15. So finally in conclusion you have to write learning outcomes 
16. We have to prove in this project that, before and after  efficiency of hydrogen production, take inputs and see output
17. So in given ( by default ) efficiency take fixed input, find out what will be output and this will be our base output and we will vary the efficiency and compare it with base output till we get maximum difference 
18. How the efficiency of electrolyser is evaluated
19. You can read books
20. Basic of electrolyser?

## Meeting at h2E company ( with engineer )
Summary of what happened there:

Mam told us to go to company, so we gone there, manager got angry saying that keep some professionalism in you, you can't come here directly like this and... bla bla bla teaching us some professionalism 😂 

next we meet to a very polite calm engineer there he just guided us what to do and he was told that we can buy there model and combine theoretical data with practical data with our hardware ( basically he was selling that model to us)
