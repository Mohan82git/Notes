# **Roadmap for React.js (4 Months)**

**Goal:** Learn **React.js** to build **interactive, high-performance web applications** with modern best practices.

---

## **Phase 1: React.js Fundamentals (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **What is React.js?** (SPA vs Traditional Web Apps)  
✔ **JSX (JavaScript XML) Basics**  
✔ **Components & Props** (`function components`, `props`)  
✔ **State & Events Handling** (`useState`, event handlers)  
✔ **React Rendering & Reconciliation**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Build a **simple React component with props & state**  
✅ Create a **button that updates state on click**  
✅ Develop a **small multi-component app (e.g., a counter, a to-do list)**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Mutating **state directly** instead of using `setState`  
❌ Not **splitting components properly**, leading to bloated files  
❌ Forgetting to **use `key` props** when rendering lists

---

## **Phase 2: Working with React Hooks & Routing (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext)**  
✔ **Handling Forms & Controlled Components**  
✔ **React Router for Navigation** (`BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Link`)  
✔ **Fetching Data with `fetch` & `axios` (useEffect & API Calls)**  
✔ **Handling Side Effects & Cleanup**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Build a **React app with multiple pages using React Router**  
✅ Create **a form with validation using controlled inputs**  
✅ Fetch **data from an API and display it dynamically**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Forgetting **dependency arrays in `useEffect`**, causing infinite loops  
❌ Using **`useState` when `useReducer` is a better choice**  
❌ Not wrapping **expensive operations in `useMemo` or `useCallback`**

---

## **Phase 3: Advanced React (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **Context API & State Management (Redux, Zustand, Recoil)**  
✔ **Performance Optimization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)**  
✔ **Error Handling & Boundary Components (`componentDidCatch`)**  
✔ **Custom Hooks for Reusability**  
✔ **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Build a **global state management system with Context API or Redux**  
✅ Create **custom hooks for repeated logic (e.g., useFetch, useAuth)**  
✅ Optimize **a React app with code splitting & lazy loading**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Overusing **Redux when Context API or local state is enough**  
❌ Not handling **errors in async functions properly**  
❌ Using **too many unnecessary re-renders**, affecting performance

---

## **Phase 4: React with Backend & Deployment (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **Connecting React with a Backend (Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, or Laravel API)**  
✔ **Authentication (JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth)**  
✔ **Testing React Apps (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)**  
✔ **Deploying React Apps (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Docker)**  
✔ **Best Practices for Production-Ready Apps**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Create **a full-stack app with a backend API**  
✅ Implement **authentication & role-based access control**  
✅ Deploy **a React app with CI/CD automation**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Not **separating frontend & backend concerns properly**  
❌ Ignoring **security vulnerabilities (CORS, XSS, CSRF)**  
❌ Using **console.log instead of proper logging & debugging tools**

---

## **Final Project: Develop & Showcase a Full-Stack React App (3 Weeks)**

✅ **Choose one:**  
1️⃣ **Build a React-based dashboard with authentication**  
2️⃣ **Develop a social media-like app with backend integration**  
3️⃣ **Create an e-commerce site with cart, payment, and authentication**
