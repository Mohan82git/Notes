Teaching quality isn't very good (-1)
At starting they covered beginner topics with examples very smoothly,
But at the time of core & important concepts they were literally using chatgpt to teach ! (-2)

Yes, we can do hands on practise anytime in it's working hours, there is no restriction regarding how much hours are you doing practice in there computer labs (+1)
Faculty is supportive, they can solve 'most' of the doubts, and give interview questions (+1) 

Final feedback: 

I prefer that: Teachers should avoid using chatgpt during lectures and prepare thoroughly before the lecture.
It should'nt be compulsion to read that lengthy official documentations, atleast "Mostly used & frequently asked" concepts should be teached.
