Here's a revised plan for the remaining time:

1. Study Session 1 (7:00 - 7:30 pm): Start with 30 minutes of focused study on one of your exam subjects.


2. Aarti (7:30 - 8:00 pm)


3. Study Session 2 (8:00 - 9:00 pm): Continue studying with a focused hour, covering key topics or challenging areas.


4. Dinner Break (9:00 - 9:30 pm)


5. Stock Market Study (9:30 - 10:30 pm): Dedicate this hour to stock market study, reviewing graphs, news, or patterns.


6. Work (10:30 - 11:30 pm)



If you’re up for it, you could consider a final short study session (11:30 pm - 12:00 am) to review any remaining exam material briefly.
