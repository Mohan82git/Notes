- If equation is given in y' form, convert it into following format$$\frac {d^n} {dt^n}$$
- For y = t
- Take Laplace transform of LHS and RHS
- Substitute values of y'(0), y(0), if any given
- Solve and keep Y(S) at LHS and short everything to right side
- Solve by partial fraction 
- You will get different fractions$$Y(S) =\frac {a}{b}+\frac {c}{d}+\frac {e}{f}$$
- Take Inverse Laplace Transform of both sides $$L^{-1}\left [{Y(S)} \right ]=L^{-1}\left [{\frac {a}{b}+\frac {c}{d}+\frac {e}{f}} \right ]$$
- DONE !!
