Got it — here’s how those sectors are usually written in trade/export language:

1. Textile Industry → Textiles & Apparel


2. Jewellery → Gems & Jewellery


3. Leather Goods → Leather & Leather Products


4. Machinery / Engineering Equipment → Engineering Goods / Industrial Machinery


5. Furniture → Furniture & Wood Products


6. Marine Products / Seafood → Marine Products / Fisheries & Aquaculture



Would you like me to expand this list into a neat “export sector” style table so it looks ready for official use?

[17/09, 4:45 pm] !! MB !!: A full-body portrait of me, keeping my real face exactly the same without any changes. I am standing on a grand stone staircase inside an elegant building with warm golden lights in the background. My posture is confident and relaxed: I stand upright, leaning slightly back, with both of my hands casually placed in the pockets of my trousers. My legs are relaxed, one leg slightly bent while the other supports most of my weight. I am looking straight ahead, slightly upward, with a calm, self-assured expression. I am wearing a stylish black tailored suit with a smooth satin lapel, paired with a simple white crew-neck T-shirt underneath. The trousers are slim-fit, slightly cropped above the ankle, and I am wearing clean white sneakers with visible laces, adding a modern casual contrast to the formal outfit. No additional accessories. The camera captures me from a lower angle (slightly from below), making me appear taller and more imposing, at approximately eye-level with the upper body. The perspective feels natural and cinematic, as if shot with an 85mm portrait lens. The lighting is soft and warm, highlighting the textures of the suit and the details of the staircase. The background is softly blurred, drawing focus to me while still showing the ornate architectural details of the staircase and golden lights. same face

[22/01, 3:59 pm] !! MB !!: No matter how great a calamity you create in your mind, the world’s unlikely to end because of it – even if your catastrophic fear comes to pass.

You’re probably 

far more capable of surviving embarrassing and painful events than you give 

yourself credit for – human beings can be very resilient. Often people say that 

they can’t imagine dealing with a tragedy like losing a loved one or perhaps devel-

oping a terminal illness, even when they know other people just like them who are 

dealing with their own tragedies. You don’t always need to be able to imagine 

coping with a negative event to be able to do so if the time comes. Sometimes you 

just need to have faith that your coping resources will be there if and when you 

need them.

Got it! For girls (or people with vulvas), different parts of a boy’s body or certain actions can be really attractive or turn them on, but it’s often more about the whole vibe, connection, and what feels good to them. Here are some common things girls might notice or get excited by in boys:

Parts girls often notice or find attractive on boys:

Face and eyes: Eye contact, smile, and expressions can be very appealing.

Chest and shoulders: Broad shoulders or a defined chest can be attractive.

Arms and hands: Sometimes the strength or gentleness of hands is a turn-on.

Abs and torso: Some like a toned stomach or just the shape of the body.

Butt: Like with girls, many people find the shape of the butt attractive.

Voice and scent: A deep or soft voice and natural scent can be really enticing.



---

What about getting wet or fingering?

For girls to get wet (which means natural lubrication that happens when aroused), it mostly depends on sexual arousal, which comes from a mix of physical stimulation, mental excitement, and emotional connection.

Common ways girls might get wet or get stimulated by boys’ parts or actions:

Touching or licking the clitoris: This is a very sensitive spot and a key part of female pleasure.

Fingering the vagina: Using fingers inside the vagina can be pleasurable if done gently and with communication.

Kissing and touching: Foreplay like kissing, neck or ear nibbling, or gentle touching can increase arousal.

Breasts and nipples: Many girls enjoy having their breasts or nipples touched or kissed.

Penis: Sometimes just seeing or feeling a boy’s penis can be exciting and increase arousal.

Communication and consent: Being open, responsive, and attentive to what feels good is really important.


Basically, the key is to go slow, be gentle, and listen to what the other person enjoys.

If you want, I can explain more about safe and respectful ways to explore or how to communicate during intimacy!
