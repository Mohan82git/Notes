### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Ignoring **algorithm efficiency**  
❌ Solving problems without **writing pseudocode first**  
❌ Skipping code **dry-run (manual execution on paper)**

---

## **Phase 2: Data Structures & Algorithms (1.5 Months)**

**Focus:** Understand essential data structures for efficient programming.

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ Arrays & Strings (Sorting, Searching)  
✔ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

✅ Solve **graph traversal problems** (`DFS`, `BFS`)

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Memorizing algorithms instead of **understanding how they work**  
❌ Writing inefficient **O(n²) solutions instead of O(n log n)**  
❌ Not **visualizing data structures** (Use online tools like VisuAlgo)

---

## **Phase 3: Operating Systems & Computer Architecture (3 Weeks)**

**Focus:** Understand how software interacts with hardware and OS fundamentals.

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ Process Management (Threads, Scheduling)  
✔ Memory Management (Heap, Stack, Paging, Segmentation)  
✔ File Systems & I/O Handling  
✔ Basics of Computer Architecture (CPU, Registers, Pipelines)

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Simulate **process scheduling algorithms** (`FCFS`, `Round Robin`)  
✅ Write **file handling programs in PHP** (`fopen`, `fwrite`)  
✅ Understand **Linux commands for process management** (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Learning OS theory without **practical application**  
❌ Ignoring **Linux command-line skills** (Needed for deployment)  
❌ Not understanding **memory leaks and optimization**

---

## **Phase 4: Databases & SQL (3 Weeks)**

**Focus:** Master relational databases, indexing, and query optimization.

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ SQL Basics (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)  
✔ Indexing & Query Optimization (`EXPLAIN`, `JOIN`, `Indexes`)  
✔ ACID Properties & Transactions  
✔ NoSQL Basics (MongoDB Overview)

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Design a **MySQL database schema** for a blogging system  
✅ Optimize queries using **indexes & joins**  
✅ Perform **backup & restore operations** in MySQL

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Using `SELECT *` instead of **selecting specific columns**  
❌ Not normalizing database schema (**1NF, 2NF, 3NF**)  
❌ Ignoring **query optimization techniques**

---

## **Phase 5: Computer Networks & Web Security (2 Weeks)**

**Focus:** Learn networking basics and security best practices for web applications.

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ HTTP & HTTPS (Requests, Headers, Methods)  
✔ DNS, IP Addressing, TCP/IP Model  
✔ SSL/TLS & Secure Communication  
✔ Web Security (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, CORS)

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ **Inspect HTTP requests** using browser developer tools  
✅ **Secure a PHP form** against **XSS & SQL Injection**  
✅ **Implement HTTPS** on a local PHP server

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Not validating & escaping user input (`htmlspecialchars()`, `mysqli_real_escape_string()`)  
❌ Ignoring HTTPS & using **plain HTTP in production**  
❌ Not setting **proper permissions & access controls**

---

## **Final Phase: System Design & Scalability (2 Weeks)**

**Focus:** Learn how large-scale applications are designed.

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ Load Balancing & Caching (Redis, Memcached)  
✔ Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture  
✔ Scaling Databases (Sharding, Replication)  
✔ Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka Overview)

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Design **a scalable PHP application architecture**  
✅ Implement **basic caching in PHP** (`Redis`)  
✅ Read **high-level system design case studies**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Ignoring scalability until the **application crashes**  
❌ Writing **monolithic applications** without considering future growth  
❌ Not using **caching techniques** to improve performance
