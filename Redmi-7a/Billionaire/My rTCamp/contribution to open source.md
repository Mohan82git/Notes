# **Roadmap for Contributing to Open Source Projects (3-4 Months)**

**Goal:** Gain real-world experience, improve coding skills, collaborate with developers, and build a strong portfolio by contributing to open-source projects.

---

## **Phase 1: Understanding Open Source & Setting Up (2 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **What is Open Source?** (MIT, GPL, Apache Licenses)  
✔ **How Open Source Projects Work?** (Repositories, Maintainers, Issues, PRs)  
✔ **Understanding Git & GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for Collaboration**  
✔ **Finding Beginner-Friendly Open Source Projects (`good first issue` label)**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Learn **basic Git commands (fork, clone, branch, commit, pull, push, PR)**  
✅ Set up **a GitHub profile and enable 2FA for security**  
✅ Star & follow **popular repositories in your field (PHP, WordPress, JavaScript, etc.)**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Jumping into **complex projects without understanding the codebase**  
❌ Not reading **CONTRIBUTING.md** (Every project has contribution guidelines)  
❌ Making **random, low-quality PRs just for Hacktoberfest**

---

## **Phase 2: Exploring & Making Your First Contribution (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **Exploring Issues in Repositories (`help wanted`, `good first issue` tags)**  
✔ **Understanding the Project's Codebase (README, Docs, Folder Structure)**  
✔ **Setting Up the Project Locally & Running Tests**  
✔ **Fixing Small Bugs, Improving Documentation, Adding Features**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Clone **a repository and set up the project locally**  
✅ Pick **a small issue (documentation improvement, typo fixes, bug fixes)**  
✅ Make **your first pull request (PR) and follow maintainers’ feedback**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Choosing **issues beyond your current skill level, leading to frustration**  
❌ Not discussing **before making a PR (Always comment on issues first!)**  
❌ Ignoring **code formatting & project guidelines**

---

## **Phase 3: Making Meaningful Code Contributions (4 Weeks)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **Working on Features & Bug Fixes (Refactoring, Optimization, New Features)**  
✔ **Writing Tests Before Submitting PRs (Unit Tests, Integration Tests)**  
✔ **Handling Merge Conflicts & Collaborating with Others**  
✔ **Understanding CI/CD Pipelines in Open Source Projects**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Solve **a real bug and submit a well-documented PR**  
✅ Write **unit tests to validate your contribution**  
✅ Learn **how to handle merge conflicts**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Not testing **your code before submitting a PR**  
❌ Ignoring **existing project structure & best practices**  
❌ Making **too many changes in a single PR (Keep PRs small & focused!)**

### **Topics to Cover**

✔ **Mentoring Others & Reviewing PRs**  
✔ **Improving Documentation & Writing Contribution Guidelines**

✔ **Applying for Open Source Internship Programs (Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, MLH Fellowship)**

### **Hands-on Tasks**

✅ Help **new contributors with their PRs**  
✅ Write **or improve documentation for an open-source project**  
✅ Apply **to open-source mentorship or internship programs**

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Not engaging **with the community (Networking is key!)**  
❌ Contributing **for fame instead of learning & improving skills**  
❌ Not **documenting your contributions on your resume/GitHub profile**
