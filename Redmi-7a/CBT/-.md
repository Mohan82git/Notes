**Summary of Scam Incident Report:**

While browsing Instagram, I came across an ad promising income opportunities. The ad led to a website that redirected me to different WhatsApp numbers. Each WhatsApp contact auto-responded with different Telegram IDs. I’ve screenshots of these numbers and IDs.

Upon contacting the Telegram IDs, they introduced me to a fake betting site:  
**[91clubok.com](https://91clubok.com/index.html#/recharge)**
http://ok39.in/

They claimed to use a so-called “Boeing software” for automated betting:  
**[boeing28.com](https://boeing28.com/)**  
This is also a fraudulent site.

They told me to invest ₹1000 for a daily income of ₹2088. After payment, I was redirected to another Telegram ID who claimed the ₹1000 plan was suspended and demanded ₹1500 more. I stopped at that point.

After logging in to **91clubok.com**, under the “My” section, there is a **Recharge** option. Clicking this opens access to 10 different UPI payment channels. Each time you select a channel and enter an amount (e.g., ₹1000), the site generates a different UPI ID and QR code — even when selecting the same channel repeatedly. I copied several UPI IDs and found that most are linked to real phone numbers. I called a few and they answered, which may help in tracking the scammers.

All my evidence, including screenshots, phone numbers, and UPI details, is attached in the accompanying PDF.
